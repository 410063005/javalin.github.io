title: Javalin 0.1.1 - Fixing the package structure
summary: javalin -> io.javalin
---

<h1 class="no-margin-top">Fixing the package structure</h1>
Javalin didn't follow the convention of `tld.name`, and only used `javalin` as the top package.
This was fixed in 0.1.1, so you'll have to fix your imports.
