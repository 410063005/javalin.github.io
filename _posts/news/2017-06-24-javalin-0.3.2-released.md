title: Javalin 0.3.2 - Embedded server refactoring
summary: Start/stop is now sync
---

<h1 class="no-margin-top">Embedded server refactoring</h1>
Most of the changes in this release (~20 commits) won't be noticed, except that
`app.start()` and `app.stop()` are now synchronous methods
(`app.awaitStart()` and `app.awaitStop()` have been removed).
